# Grover Acceleration for Attention Computation

This repository focuses on how Grover search can be applied to accelerate the attention mechanism in transformer models. Specifically, we explore the use of Grover search to speed up the computation of attention weights in visual transformer models on MNIST dataset. 

The inspiration of this work comes from the paper "[Quantum Vision Transformer with Grover Search Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02060)" (arXiv:2307.02060).
